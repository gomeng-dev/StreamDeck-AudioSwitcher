## Description

StreamDeck-AudioSwitch is a C++ plugin for the Elgato StreamDeck for setting the default audio device.

It supports:
- setting input or output device
- setting default device or communication device
- either one-button-per-device, or one button to toggle between two devices
- (Windows Only) setting spatial sound format (e.g., Off, Windows Sonic, Dolby Atmos) for the selected output device when toggling or setting.

For example, this can be useful to switch between headphones and speakers if they are on different sound cards (e.g. USB speakers or USB headphones).

# Installation

Download the `com.fredemmott.audiooutputswitch.streamDeckPlugin` file from [the releases page](https://github.com/fredemmott/StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitcher/releases), and double-click it.

# Notes

This plugin uses undocumented and unsupported Windows APIs for some core audio switching functionalities. These have apparently worked since Windows 7, but they
might stop working at any time or have unexpected side effects.
The spatial sound setting feature relies on the external command-line tool `SoundVolumeCommandLine.exe` (svcl.exe) by NirSoft, which is bundled with this plugin for convenience on Windows.
This plugin is currently **Windows-only** due to its reliance on Windows-specific APIs and tools. macOS is not supported.


# FAQ

## Changing both 'communication' and 'default'

Use a multi-action switch, not a normal multi-action:

## MacOS: "Sound effects" aren't changing, or are changing when I don't want them to

This is a MacOS bug that only Apple can fix.

# Getting Help

Check [the troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide. I make this for my own use, and share in the hope that others find it useful - I am unable to offer support, or to act on bug reports or feature requests. Do not contact me for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email. This software is used by many, and I do generally fix it when something changes to break it, but I do not guarantee this, and I'm not able to help with anyone's specific issues.

If 'fuzzy matching' is required - or not functioning properly for you - ask your device manufacturer to fix their device/drivers to not change device IDs; Microsoft requires that these do not change.
